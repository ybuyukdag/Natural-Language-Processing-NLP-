Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that deals with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages.
It is a rapidly growing field with applications in a wide range of areas, including machine translation, text analysis, and chatbots.

NLP is becoming increasingly important with the rise of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. 
AI is being used to develop new NLP applications, such as chatbots that can hold conversations with humans and machine translation systems 
that can translate text from one language to another with near-human accuracy. Big data is being used to train NLP models on massive datasets of text, 
which allows them to learn the nuances of human language and to perform tasks that would be impossible with smaller datasets.

NLP has a wide range of applications, including:

-Machine translation
-Text analysis
-Chatbots
-Question answering
-Spam filtering
-Sentiment analysis
-Natural language generation
